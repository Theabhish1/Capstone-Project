12/8/23, 3:32 PM - abhinav: Use chatgpt
12/8/23, 3:33 PM - Kushal Chauhan: # Read input
num = int(input())
strengths = list(map(int, input().split()))
numCards, pairCount = map(int, input().split())

# Initialize a dictionary to store pairs and their strengths
pair_strengths = {}

# Iterate through the pairs and calculate the sum of strengths
for _ in range(numCards):
    pair_positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pair_strength = sum(strengths[pos - 1] for pos in pair_positions)
    pair_strengths[tuple(pair_positions)] = pair_strength

# Find the pair with the maximum strength
max_pair = max(pair_strengths, key=pair_strengths.get)

# Print the maximum strength
print(pair_strengths[max_pair])
12/8/23, 3:34 PM - Kushal Chauhan: Players at positions 1, 2, and 3 form a team, and the sum of their strengths is 11 + 23 + 15 = 49.
Players at positions 4 and 5 form a team, and the sum of their strengths is 8 + 22 = 30.
Therefore, the team with players at positions 1, 2, and 3 has the higher total strength (49), and the output is the strength of this winning team, which is 49.
